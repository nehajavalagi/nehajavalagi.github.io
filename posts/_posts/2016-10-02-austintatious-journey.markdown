**County**-nuous ups and downs,  
My foreign dream in a jar.  
Will they **treaty** an outsider well?  
A **long haul** ; a **lone star**.

Will they **spring** upon me,  
As I join them for **Fall**,  
Will they get off their high **horses**,  
should I stand tall?

**Borderline** peculiar food,  
Can we not **taco** about that?  
Being **desert**ed in this **state**,  
Should i hold on to my **hat**?

When they’re talking about a **sixth**,  
That’s hardly about a **flag**.  
For a **metro** that’s **rapid**,  
My travel is a **drag**.

If you ask me where I stay,  
I live on the **river**.  
Here, things set out to **loop**,  
Don’t necessarily deliver.

The **steaks** are blazing high    
And **Orange** burns so bright.  
When **Everything is bigger**,  
But summer is infinite.

When we’re out of the **woods**,  
I’ll let opportunity knock.  
For the only way it’s done me wrong,  
Is by not being New York.

But when the music is **a-live**,  
And my **boots** are a tappin’  
What can I tell y’all,  
I’ve warmed upto Austin.
