description: The Snapchat UI and UX have long being deemed as 'unintuitive' and 'non-discoverable' and in general not user-friendly. However, millenials have no problems using the app and find the 'hard to discover' interface as a plus because their parents can't figure out what to do! Also, they find joy and a sense of being an 'insider' on figuring out some hidden options. This debate aims to capture both viewpoints and study the hotly debated user interface.

Few UX critics sat to snap,  
‘How will my grandma use this app?’  
One said that they were of the past,  
for grandma’s stories are meant to last.

One said it’ll be fun to explore,  
What does the app have in store?  
Nor user nor a purpose to serve,  
Crashes happen on a learning curve.

I-con template where the UI leads,  
I’ve grown up on what Facebook feeds.  
Is a ghost an invisible UI cheat code,  
How do I disable the parent-safe mode?

While connections are made with souls laid bare,  
When private goes public will teens still dare?  
Things don’t hold with their button fingers,  
It’ll be out of date, once attention lingers.

Some asked if the model of video holds,  
When pressing matters are to be told.  
Im-material to design their visual cues,  
There’s food for thought about hamburger views.

A millennial sick with all their taunts,  
warned that things we say come back to haunt.  
And when they asked if its users could drive,  
he shrugged the shoulder on which an industry rides.

Things stacked in drawers, user consents,  
Us teens now walk in and out of closets.  
We swipe through life, a thumbs up to tap,  
We’ve buttoned down a generation gap.

My snapcash can outbid your affordances,  
I’m rewarded for my frequent appearances.  
And with all those tricks of a filtered cam,  
it always starts to remind me who I am.

And when we get to decide what’s worth a save,  
Nothing holds me back to be brave.  
And when media tries with all its ad-ded means,  
CNN knows where to find the teens.

some others made snap such a big deal,  
stalling their progress with a big appeal.  
The founding principles laid down plain,  
Snap wasn’t for the poor to show it spain.

One was happy just to be seen,  
no likes or comments, none to intervene.  
Should I ask to repeat or be judged among?  
the minutes of the meeting were just too long.  

And while the critics and the millennials debated,  
Snapchat wondered if it was already outdated.  
All those mental models it created with pain,  
were Insta used without having to train
