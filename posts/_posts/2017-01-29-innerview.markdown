My life on paper, white lies in black,  
Pulling requests, glass doors pushed back.  

I’m suited best, branded personality bought  
My inner voice a language skill not sought.  

Bold marked words for all you’ve wished,  
I’m 21 years on a project unfinished.  

A treevial question from your paper stack,  
My book tells me when not to crack.  

For an unsolved problem, a daily wage,  
A space to fill in a brilliant package.  

My fingers dance, as you set the pace.  
A rolling mouse, for rats to race.  

My train of thought, now blowing steam.  
Am I hours late to my California dream? 

The penitent pass, complexity’s low,  
I get called upon for more to know.  

Inner voice drowned by crowdsourced noise,  
I clear my throat, my best phoney voice.  

I know I am bound by what you pledge,  
I’m starting to bleed on your cutting edge.  

I for one, to grow with your pace,  
Should I let you in to disrupt my space?  

I’m all buzzwords, conversation forlorn.  
Should I have to pay for being a unicorn?  

A seat on a bench, dreams keep wait,  
As I go back on my words, same template.  

I ask you twice if it’s the same you mean,  
Do you see my reflection in our shared screen?  

An assigned team, my skills comply.  
You still ask me where my weaknesses lie. 

And in all those connections I wish to share, 
I ask for a base I’d like to compare.  

You’re open to questions, and I know I’ve fired  
“Is this where my dreams get hired?“
