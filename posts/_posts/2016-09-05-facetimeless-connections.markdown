_This poem aims to capture the interaction that happens using the medium of a Video Call in the context of a long distance relationship._

Retina displays fail the browns of your eyes,  
Caramel melting in the burnt Texan sun.  
With defining clarity, distance lies,  
I travel in smiles; it comes undone.

You’re hours ahead to a day we share,  
A frequent flier, my jetlagged heart.  
In the face of time, it’s only fair,  
Even the seas between should need to part.

We click away what we blink away,  
The sudden blurring of our screen.  
For in foreign lands, a turbulent stay,  
A comfort zone time hasn’t seen.

Is it signal’s strength that sees a drop,  
My hand shakes, your voice lingers.  
But for a stronger connection, a time warp,  
A pen fills the gap between my fingers.
