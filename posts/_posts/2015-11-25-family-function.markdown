To these **functions** you see,you’re invited by **reference**,  
where every **paradigm** with style competes for reverence.  
Families of languages they meet up every while,  
A social **protocol** such, languages had to **compile** 😉

**C**’s the older member, but still in good **structure**,  
always vary of his descendant’s **object**ifying nature.  
**C++** he solves, the real problems of the masses,  
and bridging the gaps between the seeming **classes.**

**Mr and Mrs Java** , spoke the language of the generation,  
felt no sense of belonging, with their constant **relocation**.  
Their daughter scorned, a future without a **pointer** cue,  
for she wasn’t allowed to **inherit** from parents two. //Multiple inheritance not allowed in java

Their daughter married off with XML **app**tly,  
who’s cousin **HTML** played tag “You’re **IT**” 😉 //Information Technology  
Judging by looks these two, data they represent,  
never worrying about work, they’d always be **content** 😉

Exceptional handling by **Cpp** as the function goes on,  
when he see’s the hashing **python**, ++ forlorn.  
Python’s into **imports**; he’s new in the business market,  
his face easy to read, he’s not conforming to a **bracket**.

You know these family functions, they’re oh so **syn-tax**ing,  
the constant **translations, **the conversations get vexing.  
They pretend to know all, are subject to **interpretation**,  
Once home, their own **IDE** calls for their attention.
