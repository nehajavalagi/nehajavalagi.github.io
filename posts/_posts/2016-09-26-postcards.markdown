Write him a postcard,  
when the attachment is too long;  
He’s a whole drive away,  
and your head is in the cloud.

Write him an email,  
let your drafts catch his drift.  
For a connectionless protocol,  
word’s fidelity is a gift.

Write him a postcard,  
let someone find the way  
For there’s no bouncing back,  
when faith’s leap goes astray.

Write him an email,  
so you’ll catch the red flags;  
When the places your handshakes,  
won’t be marked up by tags.

Write him a postcard,  
so you’ll know if he’s composed,  
If the emptiness of the subject,  
Has slid windows closed.

Write him an email,  
At the rate which he’s running  
And both of you can now pretend,  
you just didn’t see it coming.

Write him a postcard,  
let it reach him too late,  
It’s an encryption that says,  
words don’t change with date.
