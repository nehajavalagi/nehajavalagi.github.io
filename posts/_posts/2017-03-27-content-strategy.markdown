_SEO, you think you can write for the web? Writing for the web is an ardous task especially considering our dwindling attention spans and our habit of skimming through information. Thus, writing for the web requires a deeper understanding of people's online reading patterns. Here are some tips for writing effectively for the web._


1) **Content : To what degree?**  
Content is not what you make for users. It is what you make users.

2) **Optimised for people**  
Content that doesn’t click with people won’t ad revenue.

3) **Dig your face in a book of facts**  
Never elect to be silent to see a better ‘Day’. Alternate realities and facts are oculus windows that create rifts.

4) **Baiting pros are cons**  
Help scoop up the whooping mess on the internet caused by content that goes down a point every time. 

5) **The hands of time scroll faster**  
Oh, snap! How do you write for millennials with a 7 second attention span? Filter text to say what you need to without losing character. #Words #shouldn’t #just #tag #along #should #they? 

6) **The figures of speech should be exercised and maintained**  
As users read between the lines, remember to make a (correct) mark. Grammar is cool and we’re the punktuators.

7) **Level the reading play field**   
Are you smarter than the average 5th grader? While Brobdingnagion words define their own space, transcend to say it better.

8) **In-credible content**  
It is important to note that attributers and contributors should have due re-cognition. The links you create with people, will be a result ranked higher.

9) **Web of complex connections**  
If your audience encounters jargon they're far gone. Understand your audience, so you do them write.

10) **Small screen to a wordy view?**  
Users should be left to their own devices. Writing should come in all sizes.
