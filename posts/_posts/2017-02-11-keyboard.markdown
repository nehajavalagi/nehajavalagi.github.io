**Escaping letter grades, I scale.**  
A corner office, **chamber** lain.

A **lonely chair** in **hard-earned seats.**  
**Ivory** about my **excel sheets**.

**Black and white**, coloured vision,  
**Hard hitting** truths with such **precision**.

**Keys** to success, buttons of power,  
**Playing by ear**, a working hour.

A conductor in a mission control,  
I **beat** me to get a fuller **score**.

A **solo effort**, **note** handful **staff**,  
Shifting options, a rising graph.

A **foot put down**, a **sustain**able invest,  
Right hands **accompany** **instrumental** success.

**Pedal** to the metal, fast forward strokes,  
A Success dash; board meeting hopes.

Raised Thinking caps locked in place,  
A **striking chord**, I command my space.

World plays its move, I’m keeping tabs,  
For ideas **grand** make **pitch** perfect jabs.

In a place that works in controlled ways,  
I’m leaving marks where the **line breaks**.

In Deleted scenes, I search a woman’s name,  
Seeking Shifted results in a number game.

A level field, a raised voice a racket.  
To say nothing functions between a bracket.

A screening process, I’m burning bright  
There’s no fading with this backed up light.

An Entered space to return to grow,  
**I’m a pianist on a MacBook pro.**
