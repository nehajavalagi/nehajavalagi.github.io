A **designer of an everyday thing** called life,  
**A dis-play** on words, I **interact.**  
I’m a **poster** girl for a **developing** alliance,  
**Engaged** to marry **design** and **science**.

Not their type; I’m **programmed to decode**  
Their **objective language**, your **subjective view**.  
Over **Java**, spill your beans and anecdotes.  
I’ll pay you back, I’m taking notes.

**Rendering** screens that **touch** your life,  
I’m an **icon** waiting to be discovered.  
I build things so you don’t **click** alone,  
Putting the ‘I’ first on your phone.

**Play on stores**, see a market g-**app**,  
Dancing on **algorythms**, a **sampled** track.  
Students **IOT**-a experience, not lacking **in-tuition**  
**Connecting dots**, a forward **transition**.

When the future is now**, i-no-wait**,  
I dream in clouds, **invision**, **sketch**.  
New Times girl with a friendly **interface**.  
I see a canvas in python’s blank space.

My mind and heart are a focus group,  
Connecting hands that hold devices.  
On a **Like-rt scale**, your **Wireframe** of reference,  
I Design thinking of making a difference.

I am a computer artist.
