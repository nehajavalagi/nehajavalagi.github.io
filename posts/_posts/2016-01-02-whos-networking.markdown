*(where T is TCP Transmission Control Protocol and U is User Datagram protocol)*

**OSI layer 5** held it’s annual election,  
Which teacher had made the best **connection**?  
**Packets** and packets they reviewed **feedback**,  
To crown **network-king** of the **protocol stack**.

T’s students said T was very **reliable**,  
A luxury U thought wasn’t truly viable.  
His students said he went too **fast**,  
and made **no connection** beyond class to last.

U’s kids said he goes on and on,  
to the **disordered** mind all was gone.  
Some complained T was too slow,  
but things were better understood in flow.

T really cared if his students understand,  
every student raises an **acknowledging hand.**  
An **orderly** fellow,he **checks their errors**,  
but his **bigheadedness** gave the network terrors.
(Header of TCP is 20 bytes while size of UDP header is 8 bytes)

U keeps **switching**,he’s always on call,  
who believes good things come in **packets small**.  
A man of hi-fives ,**handshakes** long past,  
Making the **best effort**,isn’t one to **broadcast**.

**Traffic and congestion**,there was a huge turnout,  
As everyone wondered for whom to **route**.  
IP then intervened, aren’t we all a team?  
Each one a master of his own stream.
