<h4>Purpose of the project</h4>
<br>


The Russian School of Austin is a community school that offers language classes to students. Currently, the school uses a Facebook group for communicating with students, parents and volunteers. The Facebook group is used to dissipate information regarding school events, academic calendars etc. The client, who sits on the board of the Russian School of Austin wanted an easy to use, easy to update website designed for the school with easy access to information about the school, course schedules and events.

<h4>Requirement Gathering</h4>
<br>


**Ethnographic Study**
<br>

To design a website for the school, it was first important to understand how the different stakeholders in this existing system work together and interact. The purpose of the school visit was to observe a day in the life of a student and a teacher of the school to identify potential users, their behaviours and their expectations from the website. This research was useful in creating personas and making design decisions throughout the design process. The ethnographic study helped to provide a holistic view of the problem space and identify opportunities for design.

In-person interviews of the Director and the board members led to more significant insights coupled with results from survey conducted. The survey was posted on the current Facebook page of the school and families were encouraged to respond to the survey. The survey results  and participant quotes led to the answering of some important design questions.
