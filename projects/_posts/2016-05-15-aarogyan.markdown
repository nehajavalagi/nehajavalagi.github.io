summary:   The goal of Aarogyan is to shift the focus of Personal Health Record design away from data storage and towards health management. This application employs user centric design practices in order to prototype a simple health management application to assist patients in making use of pertinent health data in order to manage everyday wellbeing.

    <h4>Interviews</h4>
    <p>We interviewed several medical professionals to identify patients' barriers to health management. Some of the insights gleaned were: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> They were not aware of apps for health record management </li>
      <li> Patient owned/controlled records were welcome and was practice friendly</li>
      <li> Emphasized on the importance of patients being proactive about health management </li>
      <li> Raised concern over lack of awareness regarding health standards</li>
      <li> Importance of ease of use for patient was highlighted </li>
      <li> Concern was raised about integrating app with existent patient management system</li>
      <li> Few providers proposed a white label product to manage records and connect with their patients</li>
    </ul>

    <i> Our proposed conversational aspects to manage Illnesses through lifestyle management, localization, nutrition, exercise and wellness tips got a thumbs up from both doctors and patients.</i>
