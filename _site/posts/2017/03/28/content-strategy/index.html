<p>1) <strong>Content : To what degree?</strong><br />
Content is not what you make for users. It is what you make users.</p>

<p>2) <strong>Optimised for people</strong><br />
Content that doesn’t click with people won’t ad revenue.</p>

<p>3) <strong>Dig your face in a book of facts</strong><br />
Never elect to be silent to see a better ‘Day’. Alternate realities and facts are oculus windows that create rifts.</p>

<p>4) <strong>Baiting pros are cons</strong><br />
Help scoop up the whooping mess on the internet caused by content that goes down a point every time.</p>

<p>5) <strong>The hands of time scroll faster</strong><br />
Oh, snap! How do you write for millennials with a 7 second attention span? Filter text to say what you need to without losing character. #Words #shouldn’t #just #tag #along #should #they?</p>

<p>6) <strong>The figures of speech should be exercised and maintained</strong><br />
As users read between the lines, remember to make a (correct) mark. Grammar is cool and we’re the punktuators.</p>

<p>7) <strong>Level the reading play field</strong> <br />
Are you smarter than the average 5th grader? While Brobdingnagion words define their own space, transcend to say it better.</p>

<p>8) <strong>In-credible content</strong><br />
It is important to note that attributers and contributors should have due re-cognition. The links you create with people, will be a result ranked higher.</p>

<p>9) <strong>Web of complex connections</strong><br />
If your audience encounters jargon they’re far gone. Understand your audience, so you do them write.</p>

<p>10) <strong>Small screen to a wordy view?</strong><br />
Users should be left to their own devices. Writing should come in all sizes.</p>
