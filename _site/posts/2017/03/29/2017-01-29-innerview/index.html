<p>My life on paper, white lies in black,<br />
Pulling requests, glass doors pushed back.<br />
I’m suited best, branded personality bought<br />
My inner voice a language skill not sought.<br />
Bold marked words for all you’ve wished,<br />
I’m 21 years on a project unfinished.<br />
A treevial question from your paper stack,<br />
My book tells me when not to crack.<br />
For an unsolved problem, a daily wage,<br />
A space to fill in a brilliant package.<br />
My fingers dance, as you set the pace.<br />
A rolling mouse, for rats to race.<br />
My train of thought, now blowing steam.<br />
Am I hours late to my California dream?<br />
The penitent pass, complexity’s low,<br />
I get called upon for more to know.<br />
Inner voice drowned by crowdsourced noise,<br />
I clear my throat, my best phoney voice.<br />
I know I am bound by what you pledge,<br />
I’m starting to bleed on your cutting edge.<br />
I for one, to grow with your pace,<br />
Should I let you in to disrupt my space?<br />
I’m all buzzwords, conversation forlorn.<br />
Should I have to pay for being a unicorn?<br />
A seat on a bench, dreams keep wait,<br />
As I go back on my words, same template.<br />
I ask you twice if it’s the same you mean,<br />
Do you see my reflection in our shared screen?<br />
An assigned team, my skills comply.<br />
You still ask me where my weaknesses lie.<br />
And in all those connections I wish to share, 
I ask for a base I’d like to compare.<br />
You’re open to questions, and I know I’ve fired<br />
“Is this where my dreams get hired?“</p>
