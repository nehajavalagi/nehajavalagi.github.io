<h4 id="my-happiness-is-not-a-number-and-it-is-not-binary">My happiness is not a number and it is not binary</h4>

<p>As a graduate student I understand that the purpose of my education here is to empower me with tools or skill sets to help me lead a happier more fulfilling life and then help others do the same. With this as my mission statement, I embarked on my personal project of mappiness (<strong>mapping my happiness</strong>) to understand my happiness better so I make more happiness maximising choices every step of the way. First, it involved acknowledging that my happiness is not selfish. It is beautiful, pervasive and an intrinsic reward.</p>

<p>To start my journey, I took a Coursera course called <em>A life of happiness and fulfillment</em> to better understand the science behind happiness. The more I understand and research the science behind it, the more I believe that happiness is an art. First, I realised that I had to define what happiness meant for me as we devalue things we donâ€™t understand.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A feeling of being content with the reality of life, a sense of purpose that inspires creativity and passion, feeling gratitude towards there and compassion towards self.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Putting my happiness definition in words, made me realise that most of my actions reflected medium maximisation: forgetting what I really wanted and chasing mediums that were supposed to get me where I wanted. Where was I going anyways? I decided that happiness is not a final goal that I intended to reach by the end of this project but a process I immerse myself into whilst doing this project. I am <strong>design thinking</strong> my happiness.</p>

<p>Based on my new found definition of happiness, I am defining my purpose in this project:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Designing with a sense of purpose channeling creativity and passion to induce feelings of gratitude and compassion by self-reflection.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Studying self-compassion and gratitude encouraged me to better understand connections, to recognise common humanity with people. I believe that this was an important milestone for me as a UX researcher.</p>

<h3 id="project-description">Project Description</h3>

<p>Glee.me is a smartphone application that uses concepts of <strong>experience sampling</strong> and <strong>day recollection method</strong> (DRM) for subjective well-being assessment. Analysing well-being scores would involve trend analysis and visualisation to promote self reflection and behavioural change. This application will aim to define design principles for non-judgemental design in the space of mental health applications. Over the course of this project, I will maintain a happiness diary, take weekly subjective well-being tests, get certified on the course and create a design prototype for a smartphone application called Glee.me. In the end I hope to answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Did self-tracking my happiness represent my happiness trends accurately ?</li>
  <li>Did self-tracking improve my happiness levels ?</li>
  <li>Did I find correlations in my mediums and the reasons for my happiness ?</li>
  <li>Did this tool empower me in my search for happiness ?</li>
  <li>Did I feel objectively judged/ depressed / insecure about the happiness scores I received ?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="initial-work">Initial work</h3>

<p>Before I started designing the application, I decided to evaluate existing applications in the space of mood tracking and mental health. These included: Mood track, Track my Happiness, moodPanda etc and evaluated them on a general health application evaluation scale. Pain points and features were extracted.</p>
